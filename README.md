# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

This is a scheduling tool to help people organize their day. Bootstrap and jquery and moment.js are linked to this webpage. In the html, divs were made to host the hour blocks. 
Bootstrap was used to style the div elements and make them justify center. 
JQuery was used to link the Ids in the divs to variables and then set those variable to local storage. 
Moment was used to have the actual time displayed and to run the logic of the changing color backgrounds.
